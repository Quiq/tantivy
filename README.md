# Tantivy

## Tantivy bindings for Javascript

## NOTE

This project shares the same name for the Rust crate [tantivy](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy). This project intends to provide bindings to the Rust crate for Javascript and therefore has the same name.

### Prerequisites

In addition to the build tools needed to development `sanity` you will need:

- At least `rustc 1.33.0-stable`
- The Neon [platform dependences](https://neon-bindings.com/docs/getting-started#install-node-build-tools/)  

### Build

1. `npm i` in `tantivy`'s project root.

2. Thereafter run `npm build`.

So far, this has only been tested on Windows & Linux, I will update this document as soon as I have confirmed this workflow on different platforms.

### API
